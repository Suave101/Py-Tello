#DOCUMENTATION
Hello welcome to the documentation page. :)

#Getting Started
First you need to download these files to the directory you want then you have to write the python file you want
in that same directory. For help type helpt()

Chapter 1 Basic Starting Stuff
The "EnterSession()" command can be used to start the programing session of programming your drone.
You need to use this command to use any of the other commands eccept for the kill command.
To end the program you need to run the ExitSession() command.
To takeoff you need to use the "takeoff()" command.
To land you need to use the "land()" command. This is essential to flying your drone or else you will not be able to 

Chapter 2 Basic Moving
When flying your drone you need to program it to move. The move() command makes your drone move, it requires you to
put the direction and amount inside the command for example:
'''
EnterSession()
takeoff()
move('forward', 100)
move('back', 100)
move('left', 100)
move('right', 100)
move('up', 10)
move('down', 10)
land()
ExitSession()
# These are all the possible commands
'''

Chapter 3 Tricks and Rotation
To rotate you use the rotate() command for example:
'''
EnterSession()
takeoff()
# These are the two available rotation methods:
# Counter Clockwise
rotate('ccw', 90)
# Clockwise
rotate('cw', 90)
land()
ExitSession()
'''
Sometimes you may want to impress you friends with your programming skills, to do this
you may want to do a trick. The only trick available right now is the flip() command
This is how it works:
'''
EnterSession()
takeoff()
flip('fowrward')
flip('backward')
flip('left')
flip('right')
land()
ExitSession()
'''

Chapter 4 Advanced Stuff
If you want to crash your drone as a prank then this is the code for you:
'''
EnterSession()
takeoff()
estop('GOHSU2020')
land()
ExitSession()
'''
The pre-set clerence code to crash the drone is "GOHSU2020" you can change it in the
program named Py-Tello.py in the second line of code where there is a var named pw.

This is the command you may not want to use, it is the kill() command
you can delete any file in the directory the librarys in. You need the file name
then clerence codes, if you would like to bypass the clerence codes you will need
to create a diffrent one that the set one in the second field then you need to type
the exact same thing in the third. No Example due to level of danger.
