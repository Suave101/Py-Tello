For this program to work you need to have python 3 installed. You need to download the file Main.py to a directory named "TelloFlight" then you need to make a new file that ends in .py for example "example.py". At the begining of the your file you create you need to add the following command:

from TelloFlight import Main

When programming you must use the "init()" command at the begining of the file if you want the program to work unless you know what your doing and how the program works.
