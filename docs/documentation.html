<h3>send()</h3>
- Takes 1 argument<br>
  - Argument<br>
- Sends information to the aircraft<br>

<h3>command()</h3>
- Takes no arguments<br>
- Puts the drone in command mode(not required if using "init()" command)<br>
<h3>recv()</h3>
- recives information from drone and prints it in cli<br>
- Use the following command if you do not use "init()" command to recive informantion from the drone<br>
